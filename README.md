# Cryptocurrency-Portolio


In this project you can extract current crypto market trends using the CoinMarketCap API. With this you can monitor and watch the crypto market.

- Read the official [API documentation](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/)
- For the pro version, get an API Key on the [Developper Portal](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/)
- Be sure to replace the API Key in sample code with your own.

- `logger`: you can give a custom logger.
- `version`: set the version in the URL, for futures version.

__Methods__

__Additionnal Parameters__

- `api_version` (str): if given, will fetch the given version of the endpoint (default is equal to the given version in the CoinMarketCapAPI instance wich is actually `v1`). As mentioned in the list above, some endpoints are "v2" by default.

__Example__

Assuming you want to get informations about bitcoin. First, read the [documentation]((https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyInfo)) of the corresponding __cryptocurrency_info__ endpoint. 
  - You can pass the `symbol` parameter like : `cmc.cryptocurrency_info(symbol='BTC')`
  - or with the `slug` parameter : `cmc.cryptocurrency_info(slug='bitcoin')`

You can switch easly in the __sandbox mode__ without giving an API key or by setting it to `None` :
  - `cmc = CoinMarketCapAPI() # You are in sandbox environnement`

You can enable a __debuging mode__, just set `debug` to `True` to main class:

```python
cmc = CoinMarketCapAPI(debug=True)
cmc.cryptocurrency_info(symbol='BTC')
```

This will produce this output :

```
2019-04-06 16:03:04,716 root         DEBUG    GET SANDBOX 'v1/cryptocurrency/info'
PARAMETERS: {'symbol': 'BTC'}
2019-04-06 16:03:05,004 root         DEBUG    RESPONSE: 288ms OK: {u'BTC': {u'category': u'coin', u'name': u'Bitcoin', u'tags': [u'mineable'], u'symbol': u'BTC', u'id': 1, [...]}
```


Optionnaly, you can pass (on-the-fly) a __specific version__ of an endpoint by given the `api_version` keyword argument directly to a method:
```python
cmc.cryptocurrency_listings_latest(..., api_version="v1.1")
```

### Response

__Synopsis__

You get results of the API in a `Response` instance. 

__Property__

Corresponding to [standards and conventions](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#section/Standards-and-Conventions):

- `data` (__dict__): will give you the result.
- `status` (__dict__): the status object always included for both successful calls and failures.
- `credit_count` (__int__): the number of credits this call utilized.
- `elapsed` (__int__):  the number of milliseconds it took to process the request to the server.
- `total_elapsed` (__int__): the total number of milliseconds it took to process the request.
- `timesamp` (__str__): current time on the server when the call was executed.
- `error_code` (__str | None__): In case of an error has been raised, this property will give you the status error code.
- `error_message` (__str | None__): In case of an error has been raised, this property will give details about error.
- `error` (__bool__): True if an error has been raised.

__Example__

```python
r = cmc.cryptocurrency_info(symbol='BTC')
print(repr(r.status))
print(repr(r.data))
print(repr(r.credit_count))
```

### CoinMarketCapAPIError

__Synopsis__

If API returns an error, `CoinMarketCapAPI` will raise a `CoinMarketCapAPIError`.

__Property__

- `rep` (__Response | None__): will give you a `Response` instance or `None` if request failed for an other reason than a server error.

__Example__

```python

from coinmarketcapapi import CoinMarketCapAPI, CoinMarketCapAPIError

cmc = CoinMarketCapAPI('{YOUR_API_KEY}') # Pro environnement
# cmc = CoinMarketCapAPI() # Sandbox environnement

try:
  r = cmc.cryptocurrency_info(symbol='BTC')
except CoinMarketCapAPIError as e:
  r = e.rep
  print(repr(r.error))
  print(repr(r.status))
  print(repr(r.data))

```
